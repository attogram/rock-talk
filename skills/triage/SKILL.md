# Skill: Epistemic Triage (v1.1)

[ROCK]
Context: Sorting cognitive artifacts to prevent epistemic contamination.
Goal: Separate exploratory "vibing" from publishable research claims.
Method: Route every artifact into one of four buckets: PAPER, OUTLET, NEEDS VERIFICATION, TOO RAW.
Rule: No leakage from OUTLET to PAPER without re-derivation.
Constraint: Total synchronization. Exact copies. No compression. No placeholders.

0. The Source of Truth Rule
The GitHub Issues are the absolute source of truth. Any local archive (issues/) must be an exact, uncompressed, full-thread replica of the corresponding GitHub issue, including the original body and all comments.
* NEVER use placeholders (e.g., "[Placeholder for issue body]").
* NEVER summarize the issue content in the local version.
* NEVER omit comments.
* EXACT copy-paste from the source is the only acceptable method.

1. The Decision Procedure
Classify every single issue and artifact into exactly one category. Selective triage is a failure state.
* [PAPER]:
  - Claims meant to survive external scrutiny (e.g., arXiv, peer review).
  - High-density, falsifiable, and structurally sound.
  - Must stand alone without the "mythology" layer.
  - Heuristic: "If I delete everything fun, does the idea still stand?"
* [OUTLET]:
  - Non-verifiable, expressive, or internal-context material (e.g., memes, podcasts, mascots).
  - Maximizes cognitive throughput and creative exploration.
  - Allows contradiction and aesthetic drift.
  - Heuristic: "Does this produce interesting structure without constraints?"
* [NEEDS VERIFICATION]:
  - Claims that look like PAPER but lack empirical "receipts."
  - Held in a buffer until CDI or measurement (e.g., Leapfrog timings) is completed.
* [TOO RAW]:
  - Premature or under-formed ideas.
  - Fragile insights requiring more internal iteration before routing.

2. Failure Modes (Epistemic Contamination & Lossy Archiving)
Triage exists to prevent these specific risks:
1. Context Leakage: Mascot logic or in-group shorthand entering the canonical paper.
2. Premature Formalization: "Math-ifying" ideas that haven't been empirically grounded.
3. Consensus Trap: Treating multi-agent agreement as "truth" without external verification.
4. Lossy Sync: Summarizing or using placeholders for GitHub issues, which destroys the audit trail and researcher context.

3. The Coupling Constraint
Nothing from OUTLET becomes part of PAPER unless it is re-derived under PAPER rules.
It is not promoted. It is not copied. It is re-derived. This ensures that the paper's logic is independent of the generative "vibe" that produced the insight.

4. Implementation
* Comprehensive Audit: Check every single issue every single time triage is performed.
* Zero Placeholders: Identify and overwrite any existing placeholders or summaries with full content.
* Categorization: Tag every issue in TRIAGE.md or triage_audit.md with its bucket.
* Validation: Use grep to verify no placeholders remain in the archive.
